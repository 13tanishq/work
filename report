1. Repository: smx-jobs
Objective:
Integrate PostgreSQL database support into a Java-based job execution framework, ensure compatibility with legacy unit testing infrastructure, and resolve dependency and build failures.
Key Contributions:
•	PostgreSQL Integration:
o	Extended DataSourceProvider.java to support PostgreSQL alongside SQL Server.
o	Dynamically configured JDBC URL, credentials, and pooling properties using environment variables.
•	DAO Layer Development:
o	Referenced SqlServerDataAccessDao.java to build a consistent PostgreSQL-based DAO layer.
o	Ensured interface consistency and minimal code duplication.
•	Legacy Unit Testing with JUnit 3:
o	Developed DatabaseConnectionTest to validate PostgreSQL connectivity.
o	Used junit.framework.TestCase to maintain compatibility.
o	Implemented the suite() method and followed legacy naming conventions to resolve silent test execution failures.
o	Verified correctness through mvn test and IntelliJ integration.
•	Dependency and Build Fixes:
o	Resolved failure in resolving apibank-parent:5.3.1 by analyzing parent POM structure and internal Nexus access issues.
o	Fixed build error caused by deprecated placeholders (${releaseVersion}) in springfox-staticdocs.
o	Fixed ClassNotFoundException in Apache POI due to a version mismatch between poi-ooxml (v5.0.0) and poi (v4.1.1) by aligning versions.
Technical Skills Gained:
•	Working with JDBC, connection pooling, and database abstraction layers.
•	Troubleshooting Maven build and resolution issues in legacy codebases.
•	Structuring legacy test frameworks and ensuring continuous integration compatibility.

2. Repository: smx-widgets
Objective:
Develop automated tests to validate widget presence, resolve Node.js build issues, and address security vulnerabilities in frontend dependencies.
Key Contributions:
•	Frontend Unit Test Development:
o	Wrote test cases in TypeScript using Mocha and Chai to validate custom elements like smx-confirmation-client-effectiveness-rate.
o	Implemented DOM polling logic using sleep(ms) for dynamic widget rendering.
o	Added null checks and robust assertions to handle flaky test runs.
•	TypeScript Code Fixes:
o	Refactored invalid variable declarations and resolved syntax issues.
o	Improved test stability with async blocks and clearer error messages.
•	Build and Compatibility Fixes:
o	Identified build failures due to node-sass incompatibility with Node.js v23.
o	Resolved the issue by either downgrading Node.js to v18 or migrating to sass.
o	Used PowerShell to emulate Unix commands in Windows (e.g., Remove-Item -Recurse -Force) for environment cleanup.
•	Security Patching:
o	Identified and remediated prototype pollution vulnerability in the minimist package.
o	Enforced patched versions manually using npm-force-resolutions due to lack of npm audit support in private registry.
o	Removed and regenerated node_modules and package-lock.json followed by npm install --legacy-peer-deps.
•	Build Tool Configuration:
o	Configured Python paths in npm config to ensure compatibility with native module builds like node-gyp.
Technical Skills Gained:
•	Handling frontend automation in asynchronous UI environments.
•	Managing dependency conflicts and deprecated packages in Node.js.
•	Securing package resolutions and working within private registry constraints.

3. Repository: hive-datamart & sma-rules-engine
Objective:
Ensure environment readiness, harden runtime configurations, and mitigate critical vulnerabilities in the reporting and data-processing stack.
Key Contributions:
•	Environment Verification:
o	Validated Java (java -version) and Maven (mvn -v) setups to ensure system readiness for downstream execution.
o	Confirmed compatibility with PostgreSQL and Spark-based components.
•	Spark Security Hardening (SparkUtil.java):
o	Identified risk of remote code execution in Spark standalone deployments.
o	Enabled Spark authentication via spark.authenticate and secure transport using spark.network.crypto.enabled.
o	Used environment-sourced secrets to configure Spark runtime securely.
•	Dependency Management (sma-rules-engine):
o	Upgraded jackson-databind to v2.12.7.1 to patch deserialization vulnerabilities.
o	Removed unused transitive dependencies like httpclient to reduce binary bloat and attack surface.
o	Used provided scope in Maven to improve control over included runtime libraries.
Technical Skills Gained:
•	Working with Spark runtime configurations and security flags.
•	Mitigating known CVEs in critical Java libraries like Jackson.
•	Validating secure backend runtime environments for data-intensive systems.



Resolve over 100 critical GitHub Dependabot security alerts across the reporting and data-processing stack by upgrading vulnerable dependencies, validating the stability of the upgraded components, and enforcing secure runtime configurations in production-facing systems.
