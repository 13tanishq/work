1. Repository: smx-jobs
Objective:
Integrate PostgreSQL database support into a Java-based job execution framework, ensure compatibility with legacy unit testing infrastructure, and resolve dependency and build failures.
Key Contributions:
•	PostgreSQL Integration:
o	Extended DataSourceProvider.java to support PostgreSQL alongside SQL Server.
o	Dynamically configured JDBC URL, credentials, and pooling properties using environment variables.
•	DAO Layer Development:
o	Referenced SqlServerDataAccessDao.java to build a consistent PostgreSQL-based DAO layer.
o	Ensured interface consistency and minimal code duplication.
•	Legacy Unit Testing with JUnit 3:
o	Developed DatabaseConnectionTest to validate PostgreSQL connectivity.
o	Used junit.framework.TestCase to maintain compatibility.
o	Implemented the suite() method and followed legacy naming conventions to resolve silent test execution failures.
o	Verified correctness through mvn test and IntelliJ integration.
•	Dependency and Build Fixes:
o	Resolved failure in resolving apibank-parent:5.3.1 by analyzing parent POM structure and internal Nexus access issues.
o	Fixed build error caused by deprecated placeholders (${releaseVersion}) in springfox-staticdocs.
o	Fixed ClassNotFoundException in Apache POI due to a version mismatch between poi-ooxml (v5.0.0) and poi (v4.1.1) by aligning versions.
Technical Skills Gained:
•	Working with JDBC, connection pooling, and database abstraction layers.
•	Troubleshooting Maven build and resolution issues in legacy codebases.
•	Structuring legacy test frameworks and ensuring continuous integration compatibility.

2. Repository: smx-widgets
Objective:
Develop automated tests to validate widget presence, resolve Node.js build issues, and address security vulnerabilities in frontend dependencies.
Key Contributions:
•	Frontend Unit Test Development:
o	Wrote test cases in TypeScript using Mocha and Chai to validate custom elements like smx-confirmation-client-effectiveness-rate.
o	Implemented DOM polling logic using sleep(ms) for dynamic widget rendering.
o	Added null checks and robust assertions to handle flaky test runs.
•	TypeScript Code Fixes:
o	Refactored invalid variable declarations and resolved syntax issues.
o	Improved test stability with async blocks and clearer error messages.
•	Build and Compatibility Fixes:
o	Identified build failures due to node-sass incompatibility with Node.js v23.
o	Resolved the issue by either downgrading Node.js to v18 or migrating to sass.
o	Used PowerShell to emulate Unix commands in Windows (e.g., Remove-Item -Recurse -Force) for environment cleanup.
•	Security Patching:
o	Identified and remediated prototype pollution vulnerability in the minimist package.
o	Enforced patched versions manually using npm-force-resolutions due to lack of npm audit support in private registry.
o	Removed and regenerated node_modules and package-lock.json followed by npm install --legacy-peer-deps.
•	Build Tool Configuration:
o	Configured Python paths in npm config to ensure compatibility with native module builds like node-gyp.
Technical Skills Gained:
•	Handling frontend automation in asynchronous UI environments.
•	Managing dependency conflicts and deprecated packages in Node.js.
•	Securing package resolutions and working within private registry constraints.

3. Repository: hive-datamart & sma-rules-engine
Key Contributions:

Dependabot Vulnerability Mitigation:

Conducted a thorough audit of flagged vulnerabilities across hive-datamart and sma-rules-engine, focusing on high-risk CVEs, especially within Apache Spark and Jackson libraries.

Upgraded jackson-databind to version 2.12.7.1, eliminating multiple deserialization-related CVEs while maintaining compatibility with existing modules.

Carefully reviewed pom.xml files to upgrade dependencies without introducing transitive conflicts. Where necessary, excluded unnecessary libraries like httpclient and enforced provided scopes to reduce attack surface.

Testing and Validation:

After each upgrade, executed full test cycles to verify that data processing, rules engine execution, and integration flows remained unaffected.

Ensured that version bumps did not break build jobs, connector pipelines, or downstream dependencies across repositories.

Spark Runtime Hardening:

Addressed unsecured configuration defaults in SparkUtil.java.

Enabled Spark authentication (spark.authenticate) and encryption (spark.network.crypto.enabled) using secure environment-sourced credentials and config flags.

Ensured these security measures did not affect cluster behavior or data transformation pipelines by running verification tests in the UAT environment.

Environment Readiness & Compatibility Checks:

Verified installations and versions of Java and Maven across build systems (java -version, mvn -v) to prevent runtime incompatibilities.

Confirmed PostgreSQL connectivity and compatibility with other jobs that interface with hive-datamart.

Technical Skills Gained:

Remediation of large-scale security issues using GitHub Dependabot reports.

Controlled dependency upgrades in production-sensitive Java systems.

Runtime hardening of distributed processing engines like Apache Spark.

Ensuring security compliance without compromising runtime functionality.

Resolve over 100 critical GitHub Dependabot security alerts across the reporting and data-processing stack by upgrading vulnerable dependencies, validating the stability of the upgraded components, and enforcing secure runtime configurations in production-facing systems.
