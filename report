2. Repository: smx-widgets
Objective:
Develop automated tests to validate widget presence, resolve Node.js build issues, and address security vulnerabilities in frontend dependencies.
Key Contributions:
•	Frontend Unit Test Development:
o	Wrote test cases in TypeScript using Mocha and Chai to validate custom elements like smx-confirmation-client-effectiveness-rate.
o	Implemented DOM polling logic using sleep(ms) for dynamic widget rendering.
o	Added null checks and robust assertions to handle flaky test runs.
•	TypeScript Code Fixes:
o	Refactored invalid variable declarations and resolved syntax issues.
o	Improved test stability with async blocks and clearer error messages.
•	Build and Compatibility Fixes:
o	Identified build failures due to node-sass incompatibility with Node.js v23.
o	Resolved the issue by either downgrading Node.js to v18 or migrating to sass.
o	Used PowerShell to emulate Unix commands in Windows (e.g., Remove-Item -Recurse -Force) for environment cleanup.
•	Security Patching:
o	Identified and remediated prototype pollution vulnerability in the minimist package.
o	Enforced patched versions manually using npm-force-resolutions due to lack of npm audit support in private registry.
o	Removed and regenerated node_modules and package-lock.json followed by npm install --legacy-peer-deps.
•	Build Tool Configuration:
o	Configured Python paths in npm config to ensure compatibility with native module builds like node-gyp.
Technical Skills Gained:
•	Handling frontend automation in asynchronous UI environments.
•	Managing dependency conflicts and deprecated packages in Node.js.
•	Securing package resolutions and working within private registry constraints.






Key Contributions:

Security Vulnerability Remediation:

Analyzed over a dozen security alerts raised by GitHub Dependabot in the smx-jobs repository, focusing on critical issues in dependencies such as org.postgresql:postgresql, jackson-databind, and others.

Upgraded the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to version 42.6.0+, resolving CVE-2024-1597 and ensuring safe communication between the application and the database layer.

Audited and updated other core dependencies in pom.xml, including lombok, commons-dbcp2, and jsch, while preserving compatibility and avoiding regressions.

Addressed Maven resolution failures involving the parent POM (apibank-parent:5.3.1) and inaccessible internal Nexus URLs by analyzing parent.relativePath configurations.

Dependency Conflict Resolution:

Resolved classloader conflicts due to mismatched versions of Apache POI libraries (poi-ooxml v5.0.0 and poi v4.1.1) by aligning all POI-related modules to consistent versions.

Fixed build failures due to deprecated placeholder variables like ${releaseVersion} in Springfox documentation dependencies.

Unit Test Development & Execution:

Developed and executed custom JUnit 3 test cases to validate upgraded components and ensure PostgreSQL connectivity.

Built a dedicated DatabaseConnectionTest class extending TestCase, and implemented suite() methods for compatibility with legacy test runners.

Verified test execution via both Maven CLI (mvn test) and IntelliJ, resolving issues around silent test skips by correcting naming conventions and suite declarations.


Technical Skills Gained:

Systematic approach to vulnerability mitigation and dependency realignment in Maven-based enterprise systems.

Writing and troubleshooting legacy unit test frameworks (JUnit 3) to validate functional correctness post upgrade.

Debugging Maven build lifecycle issues, including parent inheritance, repository access, and version incompatibilities.

Gained insights into database connection pool configuration and JDBC integration for multi-database systems.
